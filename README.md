# Purrfect Care 🐱‍💻

Purrfect Care is a **lightweight desktop app** that injects self‑care into your workflow. Animated mascot **Patches** appears on‑screen to remind you to hydrate, stretch, breathe, and generally *look up* from the code‑fog.

## Why We Built It
Modern work culture rewards grind—but bodies and minds have limits. Research shows that *micro‑breaks* boost creativity, focus, and long‑term health. We asked: **How can we make breaks irresistible?** Answer: an adorable cat that refuses to be ignored.
